        <p>Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American
            comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business
            called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary creative leader for
            two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation
            that dominated the comics and film industries.

            In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he
            co-created iconic characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk,
            Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Black
            Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in
            superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly
            leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other
            media, with mixed results.

            Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company, and
            frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he
            received an executive producer credit. He continued independent creative ventures into his 90s until his
            death in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and
            the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.</p>
